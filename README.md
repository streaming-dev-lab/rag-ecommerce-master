## **Objective**
Welcome to “Build an AI-Powered Shopping Assistant with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Real-Time Data Streams”!
In this workshop, you’ll learn how to create a smart, conversational shopping experience that understands what customers are looking for—whether it’s “running shoes under $100” or “eco-friendly kitchen products made in the US.”

We’ll walk through how modern eCommerce platforms can combine real-time data, search, and AI to build a virtual assistant that’s always up-to-date and ready to help.

By the end of this workshop, you’ll understand how to:

Turn product data into searchable knowledge using vector databases and embeddings

Keep the assistant’s knowledge fresh with real-time updates from your systems

Use large language models (LLMs) to make product discovery more natural and intuitive

Whether you're working on product search, virtual shopping assistants, or personalized recommendations, this workshop will give you a hands-on introduction to what’s possible with Retrieval-Augmented Generation in retail.
